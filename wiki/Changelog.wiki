=version 2.2(and 3.1 of a jQueryRotate3)=

- Added getRotateAngle function that will give you current value of rotation,
- Added stopAnimation function that will stop ongoing animation,
- Added step parameter - a function that will be called every time a new value of animation is being computed,
- Remove some old code (some simplification)

=version 2.1=

 * Uncommented support for firefox MozTransform as new version of firefox seems to handle it with better performance.

=version 2.0=
 
 Because of huge change of API I've introduced new version series of jQueryRotate.

 === API changes ===

   * no more rotateAnimation function! Now instead of typing rotateAnimation(10) you simply write rotate({animateTo:10}), this clears alot with different usages as 'angle' parameter always directly changes rotation and 'animateTo' always triggers animate rotation from current angle (or given angle),

 before:
 {{{
  $("#image").rotateAnimation(360);
 }}}
 or
 {{{
  $("#image").rotateAnimation({animateAngle:360});
 }}}
 now:
 {{{
   $("#image").rotate({animateTo:360});
 }}}
 NOTE! There is now no option to animate using only a integer (you have to use an object with animateTo option at least)

   * binding function now does not require an array, just an object with hash (previous concept was... just stupid):

 before:
 {{{
  $("#image").rotate({ angle: 10, bind: [
      {
        "click":function(){}
      },
      {
        "mouseover":function(){}
      }
  ] })
 }}}
 now:
 {{{
  $("#image").rotate({ angle: 10, bind:
      {
        "click":function(){},
        "mouseover":function(){}
      }
    })
 }}}

 ===Other changes===

   * Rebinding events, now you can bind new events so old one get disconnected without anything,
   * Cleaned lot of code (smaller is better),
   * Fixed problem with recursive bind calls,
   * Thanks to Mark Hunter now last step of animation rotates to a requested value (instead of 'almost there'),
   * Removed documentation from source code as it was outdated, hard to use and maitain (use wiki project page),
   * Fixed few problems with parameter parsing/handling by changing API concept

=version 1.7:=
 * added Easing and Duration to animations,
 * fixed aspect ration for images that got different height,
 * added support for a Internet Explorer new msTransform attribute for CSS rotation

=version 1.6:=
 * refactored and reviewed code (teft some TODO's), removed lot of unused code,
 * increased performance for firefox,
 * hopefully fixed IE problem with positioning (1px difference that is visible especially for very small images),
 * fixed problem when setting an angle and it animates to angle 0 (instead of staying in place)
 * compressed size down from 7kb to 5kb,

=version 1.5:=
 * fixed problem with setting animateAngle on first rotation
 * fixed problem with animating image immediately on document ready

=version 1.4:=
 * Added css rotation for supported browsers (except firefox that runs slower than on canvas and IE - slower too),
 * By adding css rotation - fixed bug with new Chrome and Safari that does not clears whole space when animate,
 * dropped support for "preservePosition" -> from now on canvas will always have same height and width as image,
 * minor style code changes,

=version 1.3:=
 * Added "preservePosition" attribute to make rotated images appear in the same position as they would be normal images.

=version 1.2:=
 * Endless loading problem (second issue) finally fixed!.

=version 1.1:=
 * Finally fixed setting v:image and namespacing for IE - now you dont need to do anything more than just including script on page!.

=version 1.0:=
 * Fixed endless loading problem for IE and fixed a reference for 'this' in binding functions. Now $(this) in binding function refers to an object that you can rotate again.

=version < 1:=
 * Fixed problem for a jQuery namespacing (Thanks to RÃ©gis Gaillard) and fixed issue with using same parameters globally for all items.
 * Added a support for animated gifs, now you can specify if you want to support them. Notice that this might slow down a bit other things on page because it needs to render images all the time. Use it if you really need it.
 * Fixed bug with IE introduced by last version
 * Fixed problem of document.ready animations for images
 * Fixed annoying bug in IE 8 in creation of elements
 * Whole new concept for IE - instead of using canvas itself - right now function uses a nice workaround using vml:image to rotate it faster. All of you involved please do some test with this!.
 * Repaired some small bug - now you can rotate all elements like $(".images").
 * Solved some problems with calling rotation again on the same object, now $("#element").rotate(angle) and .rotateAnimation(angle) and everything related returns proper reference to newly created object.
 * Added callback functionality
 * Repaired bug with IE
 * Repaired bug with some statical rotating problem,
 * Main relase,
